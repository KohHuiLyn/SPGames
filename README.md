# SPGames
This is my CA2 for my Back End Development module! Sorry it's really ugly, the Front end design wasn't graded as much.
This assignment is a combination of CA1 and CA2. It was to make a Website called 'SPGames' where they sell games i guess.

CA1 components include the following:
•	Create a new MySQL database with the tables needed for this project.
•	Proper database design with correct columns, data types and use of primary and foreign key constraints.
•	Create an Express server that comply with the specs provided.
•	Consume data from MySQL using the mysql library.

CA2 components include the following:
•	Front-end for the web application (You are allowed to use open source templates downloaded from the internet)
•	Persistent login (and logout)
•	Search games by title, platform and price. Max Price can be empty which implies no budget. You can assume other fields would be filled up. (General Public)
•	View game details (including game info, average rating and all reviews in one page)
(General Public)
•	Add new reviews (Only for Registered Members) 
•	Add new games (Only for Admins) 
•	Add new category (Only for Admins)
•	Ensure necessary JWT checking for access rights for relevant web api is done
